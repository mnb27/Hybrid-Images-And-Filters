# Hybrid-Images-And-Filters

**Hybrid images** are static images that changes in interpretation as a function of the viewing
distance. Hybrid image is combination of low pass component of one image and high pass component
of other. At a distance, only the low frequency part of the image signal is visible while with
close look we are able to see higher frequency components.

**Image filtering** or convolution is a fundamental image processing technique. It helps in modifying
or enhancing an image. This technique involves sliding a kernel over input image and
performing convolution sum to update pixel value at the centre of the kernel. Different types
of kernel can be used to perform different tasks like smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection
etc.
